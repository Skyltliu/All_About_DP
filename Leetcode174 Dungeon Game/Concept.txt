2D dp array, each cell represents the minimum number of steps needed to enter that cell [row][col]
We can only move right or bottom, so we always move to the cell that is smaller in needed steps.
We also need to consider current cell's value, if it is negative, we need 1 + (-dungeon[i][j]) for current cell, while considering the next step, 
in other words, we need next step minus current cell's value.
