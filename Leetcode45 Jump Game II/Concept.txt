Each jump relies on future jumps, each index represents the max distance one can jump from that index in one jump.
The base case if when we are at the target already, which is 0. This means we go from right to left in tabulation. 
1D tabulation.
Therefore, each jump becomes the minimum number of jumps necessary of the next selectable index plus 1 (current jump).
If current index has distance 0, then make it infinity for simplicity.
