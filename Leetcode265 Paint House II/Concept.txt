Do inplace dp

For regular tabulation dp solution:
Leave first row as is, for every other row, 
add each cell with the min value from the previous row besides the column the current cell is in.
Lastly, return the min value in the last row

For time optimized solution:
Only find the two min values from previous row, and add their value to the current cell, 
if min is in the same column, use second_min, vice versa. The rest is the same
