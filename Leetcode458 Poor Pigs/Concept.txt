THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A DP PROBLEM*****


There can be minutesToTest divided by minutesToDie turns for the pigs,
Each pig has (turns + 1) outcomes: survive, die in first turn, second turn, etc.
When we have multiple pigs, the aggregate number of bits of info we can carry is (turns + 1)^(# of pigs).
Make sure that is more than or equal to the required number of buckets.
