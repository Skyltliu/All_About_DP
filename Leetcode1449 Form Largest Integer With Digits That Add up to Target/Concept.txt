1d dp table
each cell is at target i, what is the max number of digits

phase 1:
objective: find max number of digits

dp[0] = 0 since when target is 0, there is no digits

loop through i from 1 to target, while looping through 1 through 9 in the inner loop

find cost of index in the inner loop, dp at current target is the max of itself or stored length value of current target minus cost of any previous target.

if dp[target] is still negative then it means it is impossible to add up to target, so return "0".

phase 2:
objective: fill each slot with the biggest digit from left to right

while current target is positive, loop through 9 to 1 (greedy approach), 

find cost of current greedy value, if dp[current target] is equal to dp[current target - cost] + 1, append current greedy value to result

deduct cost from current target, move on to the next position

return result
